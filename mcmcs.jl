#### My observation-
I repeatedly run the random matrix, I am always getting a vealue r4 as $0$ or close to $0$.
The dot product of eigenvectors  from a symmetric matrix ($A=A^T$) is expected to be 0 for different i and j . EigenVectors of a symmetric matrix corresponds to distinct eigenvalues are orthogonal to each other. As per property of matrix the sum of $A$ and $A^T$ is always symmetric. In the my_transf function , I perform this operation. so I am applying the eigprod() function on that symmetric matrix.

**d)** Explain the reason for what you noticed. Manipulating the following  equation: 

$$v_2(R)^T \times (R^T - R) \times v_3(R)$$

(where *$ denotes matrix multiplication) might help 


#### Answer
The expression $v_2(R)^T \times (R^T - R) \times v_3(R)$ 

The property I noticed in part c can be explained by considering the matrix  where $R$ is symmetric.My observation matches with the properties of symmetric matrices and their eigenvectors.

If R is symmetric , $R^T=R$

$v_2(R)^T \times (R^T-R) \times v_3(R)$

$= v_2(R)^T \times (R-R) \times v_3(R)$

$=v_2(R)^T \times 0 \times v_3(R)$

$=0$

- Let $v_i$ be the $i^{th}$ eigenvector of `my_transf(A)`, where $A$ is an arbitrary matrix.

- Suppose what you noticed in part c. was true. Are any of the eigenvectors linearly dependent on each other? 

*Recall that if $v_1$ is linearly dependent on $\{v_2, \dots v_n\}$, then $v_1$ is a weighted sum of $\{v_2, \dots v_n\}$. Mathematically $v_1 = \sum_{i=2}^n g_i v_i$, where $g_i$ are arbitrary real numbers representing weights*

Taking the dot product of $v_1$ (or $v_i$) with a weighted sum of the other eigenvectors and seeing what happens might help you here!


#### Answer

if the dot product  of $v_1\cdot\sum^n_{i=2} g_i v_i=0$ which represent dot product between eigenvector $v_1$ and sum of other eigenvectors $v_2,v_3,...v_n$ weighted by the arbitarry coefficient $g_i$. 
It indicates that $v_1$ is orthogonal to {$v_2,....,v_n$}. Therefore, $v_1$ is linearly independent of {$v_2,....,v_n$}. This holds for all eigenvectors, so they are linearly independent on each other and they span the entire vector space.

## 1F
**f)** What does your answer to e. (whatever it was) say about the dimension of the vector space spanned by these eigenvectors? 

#### Answer
If the dotproduct are consistently close to zero, Then the eigenvectors are orthogonal(linearly independent). So it implies that each eigenvectors spans a distinct direction in the vector space. As a result, the dimension of vector space spanned by these vectors is the number of eigenvectors and the set forms a basis.  I have a $4*4$ matrix here. So each eigenvector in my $4*4$ matrix spans a distinct direction. it indicates that a set of eigenvectors forms a basis for a 4-dimensional vector space. Each eigenvector contributes to a unique direction with in this space.

## 1G

**g)** For which values of $\theta$ do the following three vectors form a basis of $\mathbb{R}^3$?:

$$\{[\cos^2(\theta), 2, -1], \quad [\sin^2(\theta), -2, 1], \quad [1,6,-3] \}$$

*Hint: can we (/not) make **any vector** out of a weighted sum of these three?*

#### Answer

The vectors mentioned here - $$\{[\cos^2(\theta), 2, -1], \quad [\sin^2(\theta), -2, 1], \quad [1,6,-3] \}$$ to form  a basis of $\mathbb{R}^3$, they must be linearly independent. 

here, I want express one vector as a linear combination of other two vectors. For example, In order to express vector C in terms of vector A and B, we need to make C equal to the scalar x*vector A + scalar y *vectorB.

$[1,6,-3]=  c1[\cos^2(\theta),2,-1] +c2[\sin^2(\theta),-2,1]$



from this equation , I am getting -


$1=\cos^2(\theta)+\sin^2(\theta)  --->(1)$

$6=2-2 ---->(2)$

$-3=-1+1 ---->(3)$

2nd and $3rd$ equation is meaningless. and $1st$ equation will not give any values of $\theta$
After solving these three equation, there will be no values of $\theta$.

I don't think there will be any values of $\theta$. 
I also tried to find $det(C)≠0$ to find the value of $\theta$ using the below code. But we are not getting the value of $\theta$
There are no values of θ for which these three vectors form a basis of $\mathbb{R}^3$.

The linear independent is not sufficient for proving the basis. The vectors must also be able to span the entire space, which is not possible here due to limitation of  components.

The factory can invest in making better products. 
- If it invests $£x$ per CPT in reducing factory faults, the factory fault probability scales by a factor $k(x) = 1 - 20x$.

#### Interpretation of parameter $K$----

K represent the maximum population size that the environment can sustainably support. 

$N(t) = K$ is a non-trivial fixed point, which indicates the equilibrium level where the prey population stabilizes. The value of K effects the dynamics of the prey population in many ways-

Larger $K$: it can support larger population at equilibrium. It indicates the environmnet has more resources.

Lower $K$- it indicates a more limited environment with a lower equilibrium population size

Stability- The stability of fixed point also depends on K . Some values of K may led to stable and unstable equilibrium depending on the starting conditions of the populations.

So, K is a important parameter where larger K indicates a more resource abundant environment capable of sustaining larger population and lower K indicates resource limilation and a smaller sustainable population

## 4H

 Use the `gradient` function provided below (or not if you prefer!) to implement a gradient descent algorithm, with stepsize $0.01$. Run it, starting from the initial parameter set `p0 = [1,4,1,4]`. You have succeeded if you can use this algorithm to find a new parameter set `pnew = [a,b,c,d]` that reduces the mean squared error by a factor of 3, as compared to `p0`. Do two plots:

1. A comparison of the data and the simulation at `p0`
2. A comparison of the data and the simulation at `pend`.


*Hint: to overlay two plots you can use the code:*

```
p = plot()
plot!(p, ...)
scatter!(p, ...)
```

*where ... are the arguments you would usually provide to `plot` or `scatter`*

If the algorithm doesn't effectively fit the data, why do you think this might be the case? (7 marks)

## 5A

We are now going to deal with a model of **species competition**. Two species which don't predate on each other, but compete for a limited food source. Their respective populations are $N_1(t)$ and $N_2(t)$.

$$\begin{align}
\dot{N}_1(t) &= r_1 N_1(t) \left(1 - \frac{N_1(t)}{K_1} - b_{12} \frac{N_2}{K_1} \right) \\
\dot{N}_2(t) &= r_2 N_2(t) \left(1 - \frac{N_2(t)}{K_2} - b_{21} \frac{N_1}{K_2} \right)
\end{align}$$

Notice that the differential equation describing population change of each species $N_i$, is exactly the same as for the differential equation of the previous question , except it includes an additional term $b_{ij} \frac{N_j}{K_i}$. This term models inter-species competition. For instance, if $N_2(t)$ is large, this term exerts a negative pull on the population growth rate of $N_1(t)$.


We are now going to reduce the number of parameters in our model (this is called nondimensionalisation). We've done most of this for you. The equivalent, nondimensionalised model is:


$$\begin{align}
\frac{d u_1}{d \tau}(\tau) &= u_1(\tau) \left(1 - u_1(\tau) - a_{12}u_2(\tau) \right) \\
\frac{d u_2}{d \tau}(\tau) &= \rho u_2(\tau) \left(1 - u_2(\tau) - a_{21}u_1(\tau) \right) 
\end{align}$$

where the new parameters, expressed in terms of the original parameters, are:

$$u_1 = \frac{N_1}{K_1}, \quad u_2 = \frac{N_2}{K_2}, \quad \tau = r_1 t, \quad \rho = ?????, \ \ \  \\
a_{12} = b_{12}\frac{K_2}{K_1}, \quad a_{21} = b_{21}\frac{K_1}{K_2}$$

**a)** Figure out what $\rho$ is, in terms of the parameters of the original equation. Describe what it represents biologically  (Possible even if you couldn't find its formula using common sense and after running the simulations below) (2 marks)

*Hint: for an arbitrary variable $x$, what is the relationship between $\dot{x}(t) = \frac{d x}{d t}$ and  $\frac{d x}{d \tau}$? E.g. $t$ could be in seconds and $r_1=60$ could then imply minutes.* 


#### Answer
$\dot{N}_2(t)=\frac{dN_2}{dt}= \frac{dN_2}{d\tau}.\frac{d\tau}{dt}

=\frac{dN_2}{d\tau}.r1$

As $(\tau=r_1t)$


$$\begin{align}
\dot{N}_2(t) &= r_2 N_2(t) \left(1 - \frac{N_2(t)}{K_2} - b_{21} \frac{N_1}{K_2} \right)
\end{align}$$


and in nondimensionalized form: 
$$\begin{align}
\dot{N}_2(t) &= r_2 N_2(t) \left(1 - \frac{N_2(t)}{K_2} - b_{21} \frac{N_1}{K_2} \right)
\end{align}$$



$$\begin{align}
\dot{N}_2(t)=\frac{dN_2}{d\tau}.r1= r_2 N_2(t) \left(1 - \frac{N_2(t)}{K_2} - b_{21} \frac{N_1}{K_2} \right)
=
\frac{1}{r_1} r_2 N_2(t) \left(1 - \frac{N_2(t)}{K_2} - b_{21} \frac{N_1}{K_2} \right)
\end{align}$$  -This is the $1st$ equation

$\rho u_2(\tau) \left(1 - u_2(\tau) - a_{21}u_1(\tau) \right)$ --This is the $2nd$
equation

Comparing this two expression


$\frac{1}{r_1} r_2 N_2(t) \left(1 - \frac{N_2(t)}{K_2} - b_{21} \frac{N_1}{K_2} \right)
=\rho u_2(\tau) \left(1 - u_2(\tau) - a_{21}u_1(\tau) \right)$

$=\rho \frac{N_2}{K_2} (1-\frac{N_2}{K_2} -b_12\frac{K_1}{K_2}\frac{N_1}{K_1})$

we substitute the value of u_2 and a_{12} with this below equation as We know,
$$u_1 = \frac{N_1}{K_1}, \quad u_2 = \frac{N_2}{K_2}, \quad \tau = r_1 t, \quad  \ \ \  \\
a_{12} = b_{12}\frac{K_2}{K_1}, \quad a_{21} = b_{21}\frac{K_1}{K_2}$$

Cancelling the common terms, we get-

$\frac{1}{r_1} r_2 N_2 =\rho \frac{N_2}{K_2}$

from this equation we will get $\rho=\frac{r_2*k_2}{r_1}$


Biologically $\rho$ represents the realtive rate at the population of $N_2$ grows compare to $N_1$

if $\rho>1$: The growth rate of species $N_2$ is higher than that of $N_1$. species $N_2$ population may outgrow that of species $N_1$ in absence of other factors.

if $\rho<1$- The growth rate of $N_1$ is higher than $N_2$.$N_1$ population may dominate over species $N_2$ in absence of other factors.

if $\rho=1$, both the speices have equal growth rate.

this $\rho$ is an important parameter for the biological relationship between two species.



## 5B

**b)** We're now going to simulate the differential equation several times. So write some code for simulating the differential equation. Plot a simulation, with the following initial conditions and parameter values:

$$u_1(0) = u_2(0) = 0.1$$
$$a_{12} = 0.9 \quad a_{21} = 1.1 \quad \rho = 1.6$$

## 5C

**c)** From simulating, with these parameter combinations, what seems to be more important for long term species survival in this model: its natural growth rate or the degree to which it is suppressed by its competitor? Plot ONE simulation from the parameter values above that supports your conclusion. (3 marks)


##### Answer

To know the impact of parameters on long-term species survival in the model, we need to see the behaviour of species under many parameter combinations -The main parameters are $a_{12},a_{21},ρ$.

when $a_{12}>a_{21}$ , species 1 has a stronger dominating effect on species 2 over the long term. Reveresely, when $a_{21}>a_{12}$, there will be a dominance of species 2.

ρ influences overall impact of competition. A higher ρ intensifies the effect of competition favoring the species that is less supressed.

So, the degress of suppression seems to be important for long term species survival.

The four fixed points of the differential equation-

($0,0$) - Both the species have 0 population which indicates they are extinct.

($0,1$)- species 2 has reached the carrying capacity and species 1 is tending to extinction, this indicates, species2 is a stronger competitor here.

($1,0$) - species 1 has reached the carrying capacity and species 2 is tending to extinction. So, species 1 is stronger competitor.

($u_1,u_2$): Both have stable population densities, they both coexists in the environment without any extinction. This values are depending on parameter $a_{12}$ ,$a_{21}$,ρ.

## 5E
Our system of differential equations is in the general form:

$$\dot{x}(t) = f\big(x(t) \big),$$

where $x(t)$ is the vector $[u_1(\tau), u_2(\tau)]$. Note that $\tau$ is just time with rescaled units (like minutes vs seconds), so you can treat it as time.

---
**e)** Calculate the Jacobian matrix $$J(x) = \frac{d f}{d x}(x)$$ (2 marks

$f(x) = [\dot{u_1},\dot{u_2}]$
$\dot{u_1} -> derivative of u_1$

$\dot{u_2} -> derivative of u_2$

$$J(x)=\begin{bmatrix}
\frac{d\dot{u_1}}{du_1} & \frac{d\dot{u_1}}{du_2}\\
\frac{d\dot{u_2}}{du_1} & \frac{d\dot{u_2}}{du_2}
\end{bmatrix}$$

$\dot{u_1}=u_1(1-u_1-a_{12}u_2)$

$\frac{d\dot{u_1}}{du_1}=1-2u_1-a_{12}u_2$

$\frac{d\dot{u_1}}{du_2}=-u_1a_{12}$

$\dot{u_2}=\rho u_2(1-u_2-a_{21}u_1)$
$\frac{d\dot{u_2}}{du_2}=\rho(1-2u_2-a_{21}u_1)$

$\frac{d\dot{u_2}}{du_1}=-\rho a_{21}u_2$


$$J(x)=\begin{bmatrix}
 1-2u_1-a_{12}u_2 & -u_1a_{12}\\
